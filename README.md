Hi, Iâ€™m Maren Huser alias MaHu4. 

I am a Front End Web Developer and a current trainee at FrauenLoop - Women in Tech (https://www.frauenloop.org/). I am interested in learning how to code because it's always fun to learn something new and because I am striving for a career change into tech.

My front end development skills comprise: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, basic JavaSscript.
I am familiar with web performance automisation tools such as https://wave.webaim.org/, https://gtmetrix.com/, cloudinary and laziload and applied them to make my first Coffee Shop Website load faster and be better accessible.

I will continue learning my knowledge in Web Development and I am always interested in exchange with otehr web developers.
