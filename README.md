Hi, Iâ€™m MaHu4 . 

I am a newbie to coding. I have started to laern web development with FrauenLoop in January 2022. I am interested in learning how to code because it's always fun to learn something new and to be able to change my career path and gaining more flexibility from where and when I work. 
I hope to be able to build a better profile page in the course of my learning process. So, bear with me that it is very simple right now : )
