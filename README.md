Hi, Iâ€™m Maren Huser alias MaHu4. 

I am a Front End Web Developer and a current trainee at FrauenLoop - Women in Tech (https://www.frauenloop.org/). I am interested in learning how to code because it's always fun to learn something new and because I am striving for a career change into tech.

My front end development skills comprise: HTML, CSS, Bootstrap5, basic JavaSscript.
I am familiar with web performance automisation tools such as https://wave.webaim.org/, https://gtmetrix.com/,  https://cloudinary.com/ and laziload as well as with visual collaboration tool such as moqups. 

I have applied these languages and tools for my first Coffee Shop Website to make it look aesthetically great, be responsive to different devices, load faster and be better accessible.

I will continue learning my knowledge in Web Development and I am always interested in exchange with otehr web developers.

And by the way: Before becoming a web developer, I have worked for 7+ years in the area of development aid with a special focus on gender equality and diversity. I have learned to manage and develop projects and to make them gender responsive and sustainable. I can contribute these knowledge and skills from another field to the tech sector to make it more inclusive and innovative.
